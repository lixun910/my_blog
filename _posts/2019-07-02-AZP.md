# AZP (Automatic Zoning Procedure)

Original [ClusterPy](https://github.com/clusterpy/clusterpy) pacakge (2014) only works on python2.x.

It is under revising and will become a submodule in PySAL.

I am working on a C++ version of AZP and Max-p, which will be a regionalization feature in GeoDa.

## AZP

AZP is a mildly steepest descent algorithm that aggregates N zones (areas) into M regions. "The M output regions should be formed of internally connected, contiguous, zones." ([Openshaw_Rao1995]_ pp 428).

> A steepest descent algorithm would be an algorithm which follows the above update rule, where at each iteration, the direction âˆ†x(k) is the steepest direction we can take. That is, the algorithm continues its search in the direction which will minimize the value of function, given the current point.


### Objective function

SS (sum-of-squares cost function) of selected variables: within-cluster sum of squares from each observation sto the attribute centroid of its cluster


### Distance function

Used to compute SS: Euclidean (default)


### Algorithm

1. Construction
1.1. Exclude neighborless observations
1.2. Initial *p* starting observations using K-Means
1.3. Construct potential regions by "growing" from each starting observation, compute initial SS
1.4. Get the intra-bordering observations (those could be shared by more than two regions)
2. Local Search
  2.1 (step3) Select a random region
  2.2 (step4) Get bordering observations of the selected region
  2.3 (step5) Swap any bordering observation to neighbor region if SS improves
  2.4 Repeat step3-4-5 until no improvement


### Implementation

Input/Output

#### Input

1. data: n x m, n is the number of observation, m is the dimension of variable space which is used to determine the clusters

2. k: the number of "zones" or clusters

3. w: the contiguity weights or the connectivity structure defines who's who's neighbor

4. controls: variable and a limitation value that a cluster or zone has to be restricted on (e.g. population (sum) should be at least 10K but less than 50k)
